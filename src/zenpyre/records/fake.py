    """Generate synthetic Records with Faker-generated metadata.

    Each record gets a unique ``id`` (``"doc-{i}"``) and metadata
    containing a fake author name and a single-word topic.

    Warning:
        ``Faker.seed()`` seeds Faker's shared, process-wide random
        generator, not just the local ``fake`` instance created here.
        Passing ``seed`` therefore affects the reproducibility of *any*
        other ``Faker()`` instance used elsewhere in the same process
        after this function runs, not only calls made through this
        function.

    Args:
        n: Number of records to generate. Must be non-negative;
            ``n=0`` returns an empty list.
        seed: Optional seed for reproducible output. If ``None``,
            content differs on every call (see the Warning above about
            seeding's process-wide scope).

    Returns:
        A list of ``n`` Record objects, each with a distinct ``id``
            and independently generated metadata.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``n`` is negative.
        RuntimeError: If the optional ``faker`` dependency is not
            installed.

    Example:
        ```pycon
        >>> from zenpyre.records.fake import generate_fake_records
        >>> docs = generate_fake_records(n=3, seed=42)
        >>> len(docs)
        3
        >>> [doc.id for doc in docs]
        ['doc-0', 'doc-1', 'doc-2']
