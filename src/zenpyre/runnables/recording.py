class RecordingRunnable(Runnable[Input, Output], MultilineDisplayMixin, Generic[Input, Output]):
    r"""Wrap a Runnable to record the input and output of each invocation
    to a record store.

    This is a transparent passthrough wrapper: calling ``invoke``,
    ``ainvoke``, ``batch``, or ``abatch`` behaves exactly like calling
    the wrapped ``runnable`` directly (same return value, same
    exceptions), with the side effect of writing one
    :class:`~zenpyre.records.Record` per invocation to ``record_store``
    via :meth:`~zenpyre.record_stores.base.BaseRecordStore.add_records`.
    Each record gets a fresh, randomly generated ID (not derived from
    its content), so that two calls with identical input/output/extra
    are still both recorded rather than one silently overwriting the
    other via the store's upsert semantics.

    Note:
        If the wrapped ``runnable`` raises during ``invoke``/
        ``ainvoke``, the exception propagates immediately and *no*
        record is written for that call -- unlike ``batch``/``abatch``
        with ``return_exceptions=True``, which does record failed
        items (see ``"error"`` below). If you want failed single calls
        recorded too for a fully consistent audit trail, wrap the
        ``self._runnable.invoke(...)``/``ainvoke(...)`` calls in
        ``invoke``/``ainvoke`` in a try/except that builds an
        error record before re-raising, mirroring
        :meth:`_record_batch`'s handling.

    Each record's metadata is assembled as a plain dict with the
    following keys, then passed through ``serializer`` (see below) as
    a whole before being stored:

    * ``"input"`` / ``"output"``: the invocation's raw input and
      output.
    * ``"timestamp"``: an ISO 8601 UTC timestamp of when the call
      completed.
    * ``"run_id"``: the ``run_id`` from the call's ``RunnableConfig``,
      if the caller supplied one explicitly; otherwise ``None``. This
      is *not* LangChain's internally auto-generated run ID (that
      isn't accessible from a plain wrapper like this one), only one
      explicitly passed in by the caller.
    * ``"error"``: ``None`` on success. On a batch item that failed
      with ``return_exceptions=True``, this holds ``str(exception)``
      and ``"output"`` is ``None``.
    * Any additional keys from ``extra`` (fixed for this wrapper's
      lifetime, e.g. an experiment ID) and/or from the call's
      ``config["metadata"]`` (varies per invocation, e.g. a session or
      user ID). If the same key appears in both, the per-call
      ``config["metadata"]`` value wins. Neither may use one of the
      reserved keys above; doing so raises :exc:`ValueError`.

    ``stream``/``astream`` are supported on a best-effort basis: each
    chunk is yielded to the caller immediately (true streaming isn't
    delayed), while chunks are accumulated internally (via ``+``, as
    LangChain message chunks support) to reconstruct a final output
    for recording once the stream is exhausted. If chunks don't
    support ``+``, or the stream raises before completing, no record
    is written for that call (a warning is logged) rather than raising
    an error into the caller's stream.

    Args:
        runnable: The inner Runnable to wrap.
        record_store: The store to write input/output records to.
        extra: Additional metadata merged into every record written by
            this wrapper, fixed for its lifetime (e.g. an experiment
            ID). For metadata that varies per call, pass it via
            ``config={"metadata": {...}}`` on the individual
            ``invoke``/``batch``/... call instead; it takes precedence
            over ``extra`` on key collision. Must not use a reserved
            key (see above).
        serializer: A function applied to the whole assembled metadata
            dict before it's stored, to make it JSON-friendly (or to
            apply any other custom transform). Defaults to
            :func:`default_serialize`, applied to the whole dict (so
            it naturally recurses into ``"input"``, ``"output"``, and
            any ``extra``/``config["metadata"]`` values in one pass).

    Example:
        ```pycon
        >>> from zenpyre.record_stores import DuckDBRecordStore
        >>> from zenpyre.runnables import RecordingRunnable
        >>> store = DuckDBRecordStore(":memory:")
        >>> recorded = RecordingRunnable(
        ...     chat_model, store, extra={"experiment_id": "exp-42"}
        ... )  # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> recorded.invoke("Hello!", config={"metadata": {"session_id": "s-1"}})  # doctest: +SKIP
        AIMessage(content='Hi there!')
        >>> store.all()[0].metadata["experiment_id"], store.all()[0].metadata[
        ...     "session_id"
        ... ]  # doctest: +SKIP
        ('exp-42', 's-1')
