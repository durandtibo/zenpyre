    collision check, and ``__hash__`` are all inherited from here and
    work automatically via introspection (:func:`dataclasses.fields`) —
    no per-subclass overriding required.

    ``extra`` is declared keyword-only (``kw_only=True`` on this class)
    specifically so that subclasses are free to add non-defaulted,
    positional-or-keyword fields of their own without hitting
    dataclass's "non-default argument follows default argument" error,
    which would otherwise apply because ``extra`` (with its default)
    is defined here in the base class.
