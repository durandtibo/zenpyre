class ShuffleIngestor(BaseIngestor[T], MultilineDisplayMixin):
    r"""Ingestor that shuffles the output of another ingestor.

    Wraps a source :class:`~zenpyre.ingestors.base.BaseIngestor` and
    returns its ingested payload as a ``list`` with elements shuffled
    in random order. The source ingestor's output must be an iterable
    (e.g. ``list``, ``tuple``) whose elements can be reordered; the
    result is always materialized as a new ``list``, so the original
    sequence type of ``T`` is not preserved.

    The shuffling uses its own :class:`random.Random` instance, so it
    does not affect and is not affected by the global ``random``
    module state. Note that the internal random generator is created
    once, in ``__init__``, and its state advances with each call to
    :meth:`ingest`. This means calling ``ingest`` multiple times on
    the same instance — even with a fixed ``seed`` — will generally
    produce a *different* shuffle order each time, since each call
    consumes further random state rather than resetting it.

    Args:
        source: The ingestor whose output will be shuffled.
        seed: Seed for the internal random number generator, to make
            the shuffle order reproducible across runs. If ``None``,
            the generator is seeded unpredictably (e.g. from system
            entropy).

    Example:
        ```pycon
        >>> from zenpyre.ingestors import ShuffleIngestor, InMemoryIngestor
        >>> ingestor = ShuffleIngestor(InMemoryIngestor([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), seed=42)
        >>> shuffled = ingestor.ingest()
        >>> sorted(shuffled)
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

        ```
