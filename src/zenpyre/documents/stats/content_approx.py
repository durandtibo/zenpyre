@dataclass
class ApproxDocContentStats:
    """Streaming document health/stats with APPROXIMATE duplicate
    detection and APPROXIMATE percentiles.

    Accumulates statistics one document at a time via ``update``, so it
    can be fed from a list, a generator, or any other iterable without
    requiring the full corpus to be held in memory at once. Call
    ``to_dict`` at the end to compute the final report.

    Unlike ``ExactDocContentStats``, memory usage here is fixed (O(1)
    per document, i.e. does not grow with the number of documents
    processed): duplicate detection uses a ``BloomFilter`` sized up
    front from an expected document count, and percentiles are
    estimated from a fixed-size reservoir sample of lengths rather than
    the full list. This trades a small, bounded amount of accuracy for
    a memory profile suitable for corpora too large to fit exact
    per-document data (hashes, lengths) in memory.

    Attributes:
        count: Total number of documents processed.
        total_chars: Sum of ``page_content`` lengths across all
            documents processed.
        min_chars: Length, in characters, of the shortest
            ``page_content`` seen so far, or ``None`` if no documents
            have been processed yet.
        max_chars: Length, in characters, of the longest
            ``page_content`` seen so far, or ``None`` if no documents
            have been processed yet.
        min_doc_id: ``id`` of the document with the shortest
            ``page_content`` seen so far (first one seen, in case of a
            tie), or ``None`` if no documents have been processed yet.
        max_doc_id: ``id`` of the document with the longest
            ``page_content`` seen so far (first one seen, in case of a
            tie), or ``None`` if no documents have been processed yet.
        empty_count: Number of documents whose ``page_content`` is the
            empty string (or was coerced to it, e.g. ``None`` content).
        whitespace_only_count: Number of documents whose
            ``page_content`` is non-empty but contains only whitespace.
        none_or_non_str_content_count: Number of documents whose
            ``page_content`` was not a string (e.g. ``None`` or another
            type). Such content is treated as an empty string for all
            other statistics.
        none_id_count: Number of documents whose ``id`` is ``None``.
        missing_metadata_count: Number of documents whose ``metadata``
            is empty or falsy.
        approx_duplicate_count: Approximate number of documents whose
            exact ``page_content`` has already been seen earlier in the
            stream, as reported by the Bloom filter. Never
            undercounts by much; may slightly overcount due to the
            filter's false-positive rate.

    Streaming health/stat check over a list, generator, or any iterable
    of Documents, with APPROXIMATE duplicate detection (via a Bloom
    filter) and APPROXIMATE percentiles (via reservoir sampling).
    Documents are consumed one at a time, so this works with iterators
    or generators whose full contents cannot fit in memory. Unlike

    grow with the number of documents processed, only with the
    configured ``expected_doc_count``, ``fp_rate``, and
    ``reservoir_size`` — making this the appropriate choice for corpora
    too large for exact per-document hashes/lengths to fit in memory.

    Args:
        documents: A list, generator, or other iterable of
            ``langchain_core.documents.Document`` objects. Consumed
            exactly once; if a generator/iterator is passed in, it will
            be exhausted by this call.
        expected_doc_count: Rough estimate of the total number of
            documents (or, more precisely, unique documents) that will
            be processed. Used to size the Bloom filter for the
            requested ``fp_rate``. Safe to overestimate; underestimating
            causes the effective false-positive rate to rise above
            ``fp_rate`` as more documents are processed than planned
            for.
        fp_rate: Target false-positive probability for duplicate
            detection, once approximately ``expected_doc_count``
            unique documents have been added. The Bloom filter never
            produces false negatives, so ``approx_duplicate_count``
            never undercounts true duplicates by more than this rate
            would suggest, though it may overcount slightly.
        reservoir_size: Number of lengths to retain in the reservoir
            sample used to estimate the standard deviation and
            percentiles. Larger values improve estimate accuracy at
            the cost of more memory; the memory cost is still fixed
            (independent of the number of documents processed).

    Returns:
        A dict of statistics as described in
        ``ApproxDocContentStats.to_dict``. For an empty input, returns
        a report with ``count`` of ``0`` and ``None``/``0`` values for
        the length-based fields.

    Example:
        ```pycon
        >>> from langchain_core.documents import Document
        >>> from zenpyre.documents.stats import compute_doc_content_stats_approx
