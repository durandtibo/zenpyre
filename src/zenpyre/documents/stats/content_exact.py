class ExactDocContentStats:
    """Streaming document health/stats with EXACT duplicate detection
    and EXACT percentiles.

    Accumulates statistics one document at a time via ``update``, so it
    can be fed from a list, a generator, or any other iterable without
    requiring the full corpus to be held in memory at once. Call
    ``to_dict`` at the end to compute the final report.

    Memory:
      - O(n) ints for lengths (8 bytes each -> ~800MB for 100M docs)
      - O(unique docs) hashes for dedup (32 bytes each -> ~1.6GB for 50M
        unique docs)
    Both are much cheaper than storing the raw text itself, but this is
    NOT O(1) memory overall — use the approximate variant if the corpus
    is too large for this to fit.

    Attributes:
        count: Total number of documents processed.
        total_chars: Sum of ``page_content`` lengths across all
            documents processed.
        min_chars: Length, in characters, of the shortest
            ``page_content`` seen so far, or ``None`` if no documents
            have been processed yet.
        max_chars: Length, in characters, of the longest
            ``page_content`` seen so far, or ``None`` if no documents
            have been processed yet.
        min_doc_id: ``id`` of the document with the shortest
            ``page_content`` seen so far (first one seen, in case of a
            tie), or ``None`` if no documents have been processed yet.
        max_doc_id: ``id`` of the document with the longest
            ``page_content`` seen so far (first one seen, in case of a
            tie), or ``None`` if no documents have been processed yet.
        empty_count: Number of documents whose ``page_content`` is the
            empty string (or was coerced to it, e.g. ``None`` content).
        whitespace_only_count: Number of documents whose
            ``page_content`` is non-empty but contains only whitespace.
        none_or_non_str_content_count: Number of documents whose
            ``page_content`` was not a string (e.g. ``None`` or another
            type). Such content is treated as an empty string for all
            other statistics.
        none_id_count: Number of documents whose ``id`` is ``None``.
        missing_metadata_count: Number of documents whose ``metadata``
            is empty or falsy.
        duplicate_count: Number of documents whose exact
            ``page_content`` (by content hash) has already been seen
            earlier in the stream. The first occurrence of any given
            content is not counted as a duplicate.
